# Database Synchronization Automation Design

## Overview

This design outlines the database synchronization automation system for the CMMS (Computerized Maintenance Management System). The system enables automated daily synchronization of equipment master data and running time data from external APIs into the local database, ensuring real-time equipment monitoring and maintenance management capabilities.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Automate daily synchronization of equipment and running time data from external APIs
- Provide data integrity and error handling mechanisms
- Enable monitoring and alerting based on equipment running hours
- Support scalable data processing for large equipment inventories
- Maintain audit trails for synchronization operations

**Core Filament v4 Packages Integration:**

| Package | Purpose in CMMS | Implementation |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| filament/schemas | UI component configuration | Equipment form schemas, table column definitions |
| filament/forms | Interactive form inputs | Equipment data entry, sync configuration forms |
| filament/tables | Data table management | Equipment listings, sync log tables |
| filament/actions | Interactive modal workflows | Sync triggers, equipment operations |
| filament/notifications | User feedback system | Sync status alerts, error notifications |
| filament/widgets | Dashboard components | Sync metrics, equipment statistics |
| filament/infolists | Read-only data display | Equipment details, sync reports |

## Error Handling & Logging Strategy

### Comprehensive Logging Framework

    subgraph "Logging Sources"
        API_ERR[API Communication Errors]
        VAL_ERR[Data Validation Errors]
        DB_ERR[Database Operation Errors]
        BIZ_ERR[Business Logic Errors]
    end

    VAL_ERR --> LOGGER
    DB_ERR --> LOGGER
    BIZ_ERR --> LOGGER

### Error Classification System

| Error Level | Description | Action Required | Notification Method |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Critical | Sync process complete failure | Immediate intervention | Email + Slack |
| High | Partial sync failure (>10% records failed) | Investigation within 2 hours | Email |
| Medium | Individual record failures (<10%) | Review within 24 hours | Dashboard alert |
| Low | Warning conditions | Monitor trends | Log only |
| Info | Successful operations | None | Log only |

### Monitoring & Alerting

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- Sync success rate percentage
- API response times
- Database operation performance
- Queue processing latency
- Data freshness metrics

**Alert Triggers:**
- Sync failure for consecutive runs
- API endpoint unavailability
- Database connection issues
- Queue worker failures
- Data validation error spikes

## Performance Optimization

### Database Performance Strategy

**Indexing Strategy:**
- Primary keys on all tables for optimal joins
- Unique indexes on equipment_number and plant_code
- Composite index on (equipment_id, date) for running times
- Foreign key indexes for relationship queries
- Date-based indexes for time-series queries

**Query Optimization:**
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Eager loading for relationship queries
- Database query caching for static data
- Pagination for large result sets
- Connection pooling for concurrent operations

### Memory Management

**Large Dataset Handling:**
- Chunk processing for equipment synchronization
- Streaming responses for API data
- Memory-efficient data transformation
- Garbage collection optimization
- Resource cleanup after processing

### API Communication Optimization

**Efficient Data Transfer:**
- Gzip compression for API responses
- Incremental sync capabilities
- Connection keep-alive for multiple requests
- Request batching where supported
- Caching of static reference data
