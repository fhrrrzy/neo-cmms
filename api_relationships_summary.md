## ðŸ“Š Data Flow Examples

### Get all running times for an equipment:

```php
$equipment = Equipment::find(1);
$runningTimes = $equipment->runningTimes;
```

### Get all work orders for an equipment:

```php
$equipment = Equipment::find(1);
$workOrders = $equipment->workOrders;
```

### Get equipment work orders for a specific work order:

```php
$workOrder = WorkOrder::find(1);
$equipmentWorkOrders = $workOrder->equipmentWorkOrders;
```

### Get equipment materials for an equipment work order:

```php
$equipmentWorkOrder = EquipmentWorkOrder::find(1);
$materialsByReservation = $equipmentWorkOrder->equipmentMaterialsByReservation;
$materialsByMaterial = $equipmentWorkOrder->equipmentMaterialsByMaterial;
```

### Get equipment work order from equipment material:

```php
$equipmentMaterial = EquipmentMaterial::find(1);
$equipmentWorkOrderByReservation = $equipmentMaterial->equipmentWorkOrderByReservation;
$equipmentWorkOrderByMaterial = $equipmentMaterial->equipmentWorkOrderByMaterial;
```
